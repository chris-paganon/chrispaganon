Title: Portoflio intro
Description: A quick history of my web developper journey
---

**A self-taught web developer since 2016**, I built my 1st project for a 3D printing university project. I have developed and managed several websites and **worked in a web development agency** based in Montréal for 2 years. My expertise spans **frontend and backend** development: VueJS single page apps, wordpress sites, PHP backends, SQL databses, GitHub/GitLab DevOps...

Since October 2022, I have been working as a **full-stack web developer** at the web agency [Progexia](https://www.progexia.com/). I also did freelance work for [Batimatech](https://www.batimatech.com/) until March 2023 while working part-time at Progexia. Additionally, I develop [VueAI.tools](https://vueai.tools/) as a side project for fun.

From 2020 until April 2023, **I co-founded the first online farmer's market in Montréal**: [Panier Québécois](https://panierquebecois.ca). I focused on developing and maintaining our website while managing business strategy, marketing, and operations with my co-founders. This role enhanced my **teamwork, and communication skills**, with a strong emphasis on PHP/Wordpress in my web development work.
