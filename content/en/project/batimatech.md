Batimatech is a non-profit organization that helps construction companies in Quebec find new and relevant technologies. Between October 2022 and April 2023, I worked as a freelance developer for Batimatech, improving their existing website and building a new one. Below are the key contributions I made:

### New Website: [JeBatimatech](https://jebatimatech.com/solutions/){:target="\_blank"}

I built a new website, jebatimatech.com, which serves as a directory of existing software and hardware technology solutions. This project involved:

- **Custom Directory**: Developed a custom directory in PHP and JavaScript/jQuery that is sortable and filterable.
- **Directory Management**: Developed the "backend" with wordpress custom post type and the [ACF plugin](https://www.advancedcustomfields.com/){:target="\_blank"} so the client can add, edit and import solutions into the application.
- **Deployment**: Deployed the website to production.

### Enhancements to Existing Website: [Batimatech](https://www.batimatech.com/){:target="\_blank"}

I added e-commerce and membership functionalities to their existing website, batimatech.com. This included:

- **WooCommerce Integration**: Implemented WooCommerce to enable the sale of online courses.
- **Membership Functionality**: Integrated membership features that offer discounts on online courses for sponsors and members.

### Freelance Project Management

In addition to my technical contributions, I managed the client relationship, contracts, expectations, and timelines. These experiences have equipped me with valuable skills in:

- **Client Management**: Effectively communicating with clients to understand their needs and provide regular updates.
- **Project Management**: Planning and executing projects within the agreed-upon timelines and scope.

My freelance work with Batimatech demonstrates my capacity for project and client management, making me a very versatile employee.
