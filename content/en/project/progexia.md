I have been a full-time employee at Progexia since 2022. Due to a lack of contracts at the agency I am now looking for a new employer.

I had the opportunity to work on a variety of challenging projects, leveraging my skills in VueJS, ExpressJS, PHP, and WordPress. Below are some of the key projects I contributed to:

### Stock Portfolio Management Dashboard

For a stock portfolio management company, I developed a VueJS frontend for a custom portfolio management dashboard. This project involved:

- **Dynamic Tables**: Implemented multiple tables with dynamic columns, editable column presets, filters, sorting and editable cells with [PrimeVue](https://primevue.org/){:target="\_blank"} UI library. See screenshot below.
- **Data Integration**: Fetched financial data from a local database and public APIs.
- **CSV Import**: Importing data from CSV files into a local PostgreSQL database.

Additionally, I contributed to the backend using ExpressJS:

- **Database Operations**: Wrote code to fetch, save, and load data from the database.
- **Role-Based Access Control**: Implemented data access based on user roles set by co-worker (implemented with [auth0](https://auth0.com/){:target="\_blank"} and local DB).

### Online Life Insurance Form

For [Viaction](https://www.viaction.ca/){:target="\_blank"}, a life insurance company, I developed a VueJS frontend and some backend PHP for a 20-step online form. This project included:

- **Dynamic Forms**: Utilized the JSON forms library to build a form with multiple conditional fields and sub-fields.
- **API Integration**: Integrated with PHP/WordPress API to save and load form responses from the database.
- **Online signature**: Implemented the frontend for [Dropbox sign](https://sign.dropbox.com/){:target="\_blank"} embedded signature.
- **User Experience**: Enabled clients to save their progress and return to complete the form later.
- **Address Autocomplete**: Integrated Google Geocoder and Autocomplete API to suggest addresses.

Additionally, I created their new homepage based on our designer mockups.

### Multistep Dynamic Form for Customizable Blinds

For a project involving a multistep dynamic form for fully customizable blinds, I:

- **DevOps Implementation**: Developed GitLab DevOps pipelines to automatically deploy and build the VueJS frontend and WordPress plugin on push/merge to the master branch.
- **Custom Form Development**: Built a custom form using VueJS, [Pinia store](https://pinia.vuejs.org/){:target="\_blank"}, and [vue-query](https://tanstack.com/query/latest){:target="\_blank"} (the VueJS version of react-query).
- **API Integration**: Made API calls to a custom blinds manufacturer at every step to get and validate possible options.
- **WooCommerce Integration**: Integrated the VueJS frontend with the WooCommerce plugin on the PHP/WordPress backend to enable order processing.

- **New features, Maintenance and Updates**.
