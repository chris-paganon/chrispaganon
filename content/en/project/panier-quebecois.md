Panier Québécois is the **first online farmer's market in Montréal**. It was also my full time occupation between April 2020 and October 2022. We started the project with my 3 co-founders to **help local farmers markets** when COVID started. It quickly grew into a business with over **800 orders every month**.

As a business owner, I have been **involved in most aspects of the project**, not just web development. I managed our marketing strategy, built and integrated software tools for analytics and marketing, managed customer service, prepared and delivered orders, built tools to optimize operations and purchasing...

The first hand experience I gained through running a business gives me **a better understanding of companies' needs**.

Panier Québécois was an e-commerce platform. Here is a non-exhaustive list of features I have developed:

- A **fully custom orders export** system to:
  - Send orders automatically to our suppliers by e-mail & SMS
  - Export each orders into a printable PDF list optimized for our operations
  - Custom integration with our fleet managment tool
  - Export optimized lists of products to pick-up
- A custom limited **inventory management** system for our operations team
- A complex cash back **loyalty system**
- A wishlist system for our customers
- ...

_All features were developed in PHP in a custom plugin_

_(Panier Québécois is now mostly a B2B service without the need for a storefront or most of the features listed above. Hence why the current website doesn't show them.)_
